This app was created to learn English-Serbian words. 
The UI design was created by using a reference design.
The app shows words either English or Serbian words randomly and asked to type equivalent words in opposite language that showed. When the user types the correct equivalent, the number of true increases while the number of false increases in the incorrect situation. During this process, in the condition of the user writes the correct ones, these words are not shown again. 
Lastly, the UI design was created regarding 3 different screen sizes (as possible as responsive). 
The app needs more development to get a better user experience.
